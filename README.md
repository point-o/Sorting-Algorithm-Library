MOST ALGORITHMS ARE GENERATED BY AI
I just went back in and optimized using sudo code and built it properly into my framework.

AI is great at saving time for scripts like these, but is prone to errors. It's important to optimize thereafter the code is generated and fit it into your enviornment properly.
Otherwise, using AI is as useless as glass hammer, breaking itself and everything you've made.
